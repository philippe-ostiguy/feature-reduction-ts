# Feature Reduction for Time Series ‚úÇÔ∏è  <br>


## Is Less More? Do Deep Learning Forecasting Models Need Feature Reduction?

Time series forecasting is a powerful tool in data science, offering insights 
into future trends based on historical patterns. In our [previous article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/want-to-decrease-your-models-prediction-errors-by-20-follow-this-simple-trick-97354102098e), we 
explored how making your time series stationary automatically can significantly 
enhance model performance. But stationarity is just one piece of the puzzle. As 
we continue to refine our forecasting models, another crucial question arises: 
how do we handle the multitude of features our data may present?

Learn why feature reduction is important and how to implement feature reduction 
in time series
<br>
<br>
## Usage

It is recommended to read [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-less-more-do-deep-learning-forecasting-models-need-feature-reduction-25d8968ac15c) 
for a good understanding of how to use the code and implement feature reduction 
in your time series pipeline.

1. You will need to get your data using [this repo](https://github.com/philippe-ostiguy/free-fin-data)
2. Create a `data` directory in your current directory:

 ```bash
 mkdir -p /path/to/current_directory/data
 ```
3. Copy the data in your current directory
 ```bash
cp -R /path/to/fetcher_directory /path/to/current_directory/data
```
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements
5. Execute the code with `python -m trainer`

This is it!
